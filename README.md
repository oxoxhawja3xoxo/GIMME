## Documentation for your project in the form of a Markdown file called README.md.
## This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project. Though the structure
## of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be incredibly clear to the
## staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, configure, and use your project.
## Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length. It should not
## be necessary for us to contact you with questions regarding your project after
## its submission. Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your
## documentation any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.

Hello, my product is pretty self explanatory and quite user friendly, particularly
if you've watched my video, so I'll just explain here what every route does.

GIMME:
If you're on the homepage, you can either, register, log in, contact us, or read about
us on the our story page. (self-explanatory). You can also change your password on
the login page if you've forgotten it.

Once you are logged in, there are more options. Now, in the top right next to contact
us and our story, you now also have the option to log out. Once you're logged in, you
now have the coveted option of giving a gift. You can give a gift in two ways, you can
either send a survey to your friend, or fill out a survey. There are many reasons you
would email a survey to a friend. Maybe it's for secret santa. Maybe it's for someones
suprise birthday party, so you want to ask their roommate to fill it out for you. Maybe
you want to propose, so you ask your girlfriends sister to fill it out so you can give
her something really special, and her sister knows her best. You can fill out the survey
yourself in our platform for friends you know really well. You might just want an
objective third-party who is expert at selecting gifts to do the difficult work of picking
the perfect thing out for your friend.

Once information is submitted through an emailed survey, it's in our database, and you
can look up their survey, and then shop for them from there!

If you choose the option of filling out the survey for yourself it will
automatically show you the results, and you can immediately shop for your friend.

All users must be logged in to see our gift database in order to leave survey respondents
with a sense of intrigue.

That's basically it. Happy giving!
